#minesweeper Specification

## Goal
To implement the game minesweeper in processing based on the CC programming 1 assignment

## TODO:
### Game Play
1. [Grant] Make flag setting a toggle.  i.e. flag will turn on and off.
+ [Grant] Middle click (shift-click) implementation.  The middle click will reveal squares around the current square when the number of flags in the surrounding 8 are equal to the num of the box.
This will probably go in updateBoard.
+ [Grant] Move updateBoard into Boardobjects class.
+ [Sean] Move Boardobjects class to new file. Possibly rename it.

### Visuals
1. Boundary box for pseudo 3D effect
+ Mouse Over effect
+ Restart Button
